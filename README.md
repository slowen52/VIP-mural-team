# VIP-mural-team

This code is intended for use by the NYU VIP Designing for Creative Physical Computing team. Altogether the code will be used as part of an interactive mural installation. 

So far I have put together:

- Buildings that light up and play music upon being triggered by rock-shaped knobs
- A seed dispenser that dispenses seed-filled confetti upon being triggered by rock-shaped knobs
- Potentiometers that are covered in paper to appear like rocks
